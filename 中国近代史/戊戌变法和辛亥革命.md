甲午中日战争的失败，使先进的中国人认识到，单凭引进外国器物已不足以挽救民族危亡。(The
defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War made the advanced Chinese realize
that the introduction of foreign artifacts alone was no longer enough to
save the nation from peril.)于是，谋求制度的变革被提到议事日程上来。(As
a result, the search for institutional change was put on the
agenda.)戊戌变法就是制度变革的一次尝试。(Reform Movement of 1898 is an
attempt at institutional change.)这次变法是怎么发动起来的？(How did this
change be initiated?)变革的内容有哪些？(What are the
changes?)它的历史命运又是怎样的呢？(What is its historical destiny?)

康有为与公车①上书(Kang Youwei and a)

1895年春，《马关条约》签订的消息传到北京后，群情激愤。(In the spring of
1895, when the news of the signing of *the Treaty of Shimonoseki*
reached Beijing, the crowd was
indignant.)正在京师参加会试的康有为、梁启超等，联合各省1300多名参加会试的举人，上书光绪帝②，请求拒和、迁都、变法。(Kang
Youwei and Liang Qichao, who were participating in the examination in
The Beijing Division, united more than 1,300 people from various
provinces who participated in the examination and wrote to the Guangxu
Emperor, asking for retreating from the peace treaty concluded with
Japan, for a transferal of the capital, as well as for a governmental
reform.)这就是著名的"公车上书"。(This was the famous \" petition to the
Emperor
\".)这次上书并没有上达光绪帝，却轰动京、沪，拉开了变法维新运动的序幕。(This
time, the petition was not read by the Guangxu Emperor, but it caused a
sensation in Beijing and Shanghai, kicking off the prelude to the reform
movement.)

图 1康有为（1858-1927）

康有为，广东南海人。(Kang Youwei was a native of Nanhai,
Guangdong.)自幼熟读经史，有志圣贤之学。(Since childhood, he has been
familiar with the history and classics, and has an ambition to learn
from the wise ancient
thoughts.)20多岁时到香港和上海的两次游历，使他对西方资本主义治理下的社会有了亲身感受。(His
two trips to Hong Kong and Shanghai in his 20s gave him a first-hand
experience of society under Western
capitalism.)此后，他广泛阅读了当时能够搜集到的西学书籍、报刊，钻研西学知识。(After
that, he read extensive Western studies books, newspapers and
periodicals that he could collect at that time, and delved into the
knowledge of Western
studies.)1888年，他第一次上书光绪帝，请求变法图强，受到顽固派的阻挠。(In
1888, he wrote to the Guangxu Emperor for the first time, requesting to
change the law and try to be strong, but was blocked by the
diehards.)后来，回到广州万木草堂讲学、著书，宣传变法思想，培养维新人才。学生有梁启超等。

Later, he returned to Guangzhou Wanmu Caotang to give lectures, write
books, publicize the idea of changing, and cultivate talents for reform.
His students included Liang Qichao and so on.

①汉代以公家车马送应举之人赴京，后以"公车"泛指入京应试的举人。

②光绪帝，即清朝皇帝爱新觉罗·载湉（bon），1875-1908年在位，"光绪"是其年号。

公车上书失败后，维新人士在各地组织学会，创办报刊，宣传变法，推动了维新变法思想的广泛传播。(After
the failure of submitting the petition to the emperor, the reformists
organized societies in various places, founded newspapers and
periodicals, and publicized the reform, which promoted the wide
dissemination of the idea of reform and
change.)其中影响最大的报刊是上海的《时务报》和天津的《国闻报》。(Among
all newspapers and periodicals, the most influential ones are *Shiwu
Bao* in Shanghai and *Guowen Bao* in Tianjin.)

reformists.)维新变法前，与康有为一起联合各省举人发动"公车上书"运动，(Before
the Reform Movement of 1898, together with Kang Youwei, he joined forces
with people from various provinces to launch the \"submitting a petition

戊戌变法失败后，与康有为一起流亡日本，政治思想上逐渐走向保守，(After the
failure of the Reform Movement of 1898), he went into exile with Kang
Youwei in Japan, and gradually became conservative in political
issues.)但是他是近代文学革命运动的理论倡导者。(But he was a theoretical
advocate of the modern literary revolutionary
movement.)逃亡日本后，梁启超在《饮冰室合集》《夏威夷游记》中继续推广"诗界革命"，批判了以往那种诗中运用新名词以表新意的做法。(After

is strong by reform, and if China does not change, it will perish
because of its old-fashioned observance of the
institution.)这些文字议论新颖，通俗易懂，风靡海内。(These texts were
novel and easy to understand, so they were popular
domestically.)严复等主持的《国闻报》，以"通上下之情""通中外之故"为目的，号召变法图强，成为北方最有影响的报纸。(The
Guowen Bao, presided over by Yan Fu and others, with the purpose of
\"connecting the feelings of the upper and lower levels\" and
\"connecting the reasons for China and foreign countries,\" called for
reforms and striving to become stronger, turning to the most influential

1897年冬，德国强占胶州湾。(In the winter of 1897, Germany forcibly
occupied Jiaozhou
Bay.)消息传出后，康有为上书光绪帝，痛陈时局的危险和变法的紧迫性，呼吁变法救国。(After
the news came out, Kang Youwei wrote to the Guangxu Emperor, stating the
danger of the situation and the urgency of changing, and calling for the
reform to save the
country.)在康有为等维新派的推动下，光绪帝表示"不甘作亡国之君"，决心变法。(Under
the impetus of Kang Youwei and other reformists, the Guangxu Emperor
expressed that he was \"not willing to be the last king of the country\"
and was determined to
reform.)1898年6月11日，清政府颁布"定国是"诏书，宣布实行变法。(On June
11, 1898, the Qing government issued the edict *Dingguo Shi*, announcing
the implementation of the
reform.)随后，光绪帝发布了一系列变法诏令，主要内容有：(Subsequently, the
Guangxu Emperor issued a series of edicts to reform, the main contents
of which were:)裁撤冗官冗员，允许官民上书言事；(the dismissal of
redundant officials and redundant personnel, allowing officials and
ordinary people to write to the

etc.)1898年是农历戊戌年，历史上称这次变法为"戊戌变法"。(In accordance
with the happening time of the reform, we called this reform \" Reform
Movement of 1898\")

变法触犯了以慈禧太后为首的顽固派的利益。(The reform violated the
interests of the diehards led by Empress Dowager
Cixi.)他们掌有实权，阻挠和破变法法令的贯彻。(Wielding real power, they
obstructed implementation of the reform.
)9月21日，慈禧太后等发动政变，囚禁光绪帝，搜捕维新人士废除变法诏令。(On
September the 21st , Empress Dowager Cixi and others staged a coup,
imprisoning the Guangxu Emperor and arresting reformists to repeal the
edict of the reform.)康有为、梁启超先后出逃。(Kang Youwei and Liang
Qichao fled one after

Sitong, Liu Guangdi, Lin Xu, Yang Rui, Shen Xiu, and Kang Guangren were
arrested and killed, known in history as the \"Six Gentlemen of the
Reform Movement of 1898\".)这次变法历时103天因此又被称为"百日维新"。(The
reform lasted 103 days and it was thus also known as the \"Hundred Days
of Reform\".)

戊戌变法虽然失败了，但在思想文化方面产生了广泛而持久的影响。(Although
the Reform Movement of 1898 failed, it had a broad and lasting impact on
ideology and culture.)

cover of the Japanese.)谭嗣同拒绝出走，矢志为变法献身。(Tan Sitong
refused to run away, and determined to dedicate himself to the
reform.)他说："不有行者，无以图将来；不有死者，无以酬圣主。""各国变法，无不从流血而成，今中国未闻有因变法而流血者，此国之所以不昌也。有之，请自嗣同始！"

###### 京师大学堂(the Imperial University of Peking)

百日维新期间，清政府决定创办京师大学堂。(During the Hundred Days of
Reform, the Qing government decided to establish the Imperial University
of
Peking.)它以"广育人才，讲求时务"为宗旨，准备设立天学、地学、道学、政学、文学、武学、农学、工学、商学、医学十科。(With
the aim of \"cultivating talents extensively and paying attention to
current affairs\", it was ready to set up ten disciplines, including
astronomy, earth science, Taoism, politics, literature, martial arts,
agriculture, engineering, commerce, and
medicine.)变法失败后，京师大学堂得以保留下来，(After the failure of the
reform, the Imperial University of Peking was
preserved.)并附设有中小学，不过规模非常有限，(There were primary and
secondary schools attached to it, but the scale was very
limited.)学生总数仅200余人。(the total number of students was only over

# 辛亥革命(the 1911 Revolution)

1911年的辛亥革命，终于推翻了清朝的统治，结束了在中国延续两千多年的君主专制制度，建立了中华民国。(The
1911 Revolution finally overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty, ended
the absolute monarchy which had lasted for more than two thousand years
in China, and established the Republic of
China.)但是，辛亥革命的胜利果实，最终落入袁世凯的手中。(However, the
fruits of victory in the 1911 Revolution eventually fell into the hands
of Yuan Shikai.)袁世凯上台后，建立起北洋军阀的统治。(After Yuan Shikai

孙中山早年的革命活动(The Revolutionary Activities of Sun Yat-sen in his
Early Years)

伟大的民主革命先行者孙中山，名文，号逸仙。旅居日本从事革命活动时，他曾化名中山樵，以后遂以"中山"名世。(When
he lived in Japan and engaged in revolutionary activities, he used the
name"Zhongshan", and later became known in the world as \" Zhongshan
\".)孙中山少年时代特别爱听太平天国的故事，（When he was a teenager, Sun
Yat-sen especially loved to listen to the story of the Taiping Heavenly
Kingdom）.称赞洪秀全是"反清英雄第一人"，并自命为洪秀全第二。（He praised
Hong Xiuquan as \"the first anti-Qing hero\", and called himself "the
second Hong Xiuquan".）

####### 人物扫描

孙中山出身于广东香山县①翠亨村的一个农民家(Sun Yat-sen was born in a
peasant family in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County, Guangdong
Province.)是读过私熟，14岁时赴檀香山②，就读于英国和美国传教士创办的教会学校。(He
once studied in an old-style private school and went to Honolulu at the
age of 14 (2) to attend a church school founded by British and American
missionaries.)18岁以后回国，在香港、广州两地习医学。(After the age of
18, he returned to China and studied medicine in Hong Kong and Canton.
)1892年，以优异成绩毕业于香港西医书院，开在澳门、广州一带行医。(In 1892,
he graduated with honors from the Hong Kong College of Western Medicine
and practiced medicine in Macau and
Canton.)西方的教育背景及多年在香积生活、学习经验，使他接触到一些资本主义社会的政治说。(His
Western educational background and years of living and studying in
Xiangji enabled him to expose himself to some political theories of
capitalist
society.)英国殖民主义统治下香港的繁荣和清政府扁败无鲜明对比，更使他反思其中的缘由所在。(The
stark contrast between Hong Kong\'s prosperity under British colonialism
and the collapse of the Qing government made him reflect on the reasons
for
it.)通过行医实孙中山认识到"医术教人，所济有限"，"医国"比"医人"重要，(Through
the practice of medicine, Sun Yat-sen realized that \"although medical
techniques saved people, their benefits were limited\" and that
\"medical treatment for the country\" is more important than \"medical
treatment for patients\")从此走上革新政治、反清革命的道路。(From then
on, he embarked on the road of innovating politics and opposing the Qing
revolution.)

1894年，孙中山北上天津，(In 1894, Sun Yat-sen went northwards to
Tianjin,)上书李鸿章，提出变法自强等多项改革建议，(He wrote to Li
Hongzhang, and proposed a number of reform proposals such as changing
the institutions and strengthening ourselves.)遭到拒绝。(Unfortunately,
his proposals were
rejected.)失望之余，他开始认识到，只有推翻清政府的专制统治，才能拯救中国。(Disappointed,
he began to realize that only by overthrowing the authoritarian rule of
the Qing government could China be
saved.)同年11月，孙中山在檀香山联合华侨，成立兴中会，提出"振兴中华"的宗旨，号召"驱除鞑虏，恢复中国，创立合众政府"。(In
November of the same year, Sun Yat-sen united with overseas Chinese in
Honolulu to establish the Revive China Society (Xingzhonghui), which put
forward its purpose as \"revitalizing China\" and called for \"
expelling the Tartars, restoring China and establishing a united
government\".)

1895年，孙中山回到香港，联络陆皓东等人成立香港兴中会总会，(In 1895, Sun
Yat-sen returned to Hong Kong and contacted with Lu Haodong and others
to establish the Hong Kong Revive China Society
(Xingzhonghui).)同时开展筹款、联络会党和军队等秘密工作，准备在广州发动武装起义，建立革命据点。(At
the same time, he carried out several secret work, such as fundraising,
liaison with the party and the army, in order to prepared to launch an
armed uprising in Guangzhou and establish a revolutionary
stronghold.)10月，起义消息泄露，陆皓东等人被捕牺牲，(In October, the
message of the uprising was leaked, Lu Haodong and others were arrested
and killed)起义失败。(The uprising failed. )

广州起义失败后，孙中山受到清政府的通缉，被香港当局驱逐出境。(After the
failure of the Guangzhou Uprising, Sun Yat-sen was listed as wanted by
the Qing government and deported by the Hong Kong
authorities.)从此，他断发改装，流亡海外，(Having cut off his hair and
changed his clothes, he has gone into exile overseas since
then.)先后在日、美、英等国考察社会实际，发展革命组织，为继续革命作准备。(He
successively investigated the social reality in Japan, the United
States, Britain and other countries, developed revolutionary
organizations, and prepared for the continuation of the revolution.)

####### 同盟会与三民主义

《辛丑条约》签订后，清政府沦为帝国主义统治中国的工具，国内革命情绪日趋高涨。(After
the signing of the Boxer Protocol, the Qing government completely turned
to a tool for imperialist rule over China, and the revolutionary mood in
China became increasingly
high.)资产阶级革命思想得到迅速传播，出现了章炳麟的《驳康有为论革命书》、邹容的《革命军》、陈天华的《猛回头》和《警世钟》等宣传民族民主革命的著作。(Bourgeois
revolutionary ideas spread rapidly, and works propagating the national
democratic revolution
appeared.)这些著作号召人们起来推翻清政府的统治，建立民主共和制度。(These
writings appealed to people for overthrowing the rule of the Qing
government and establishing a democratic republican
system.)各种革命团体也纷纷成立，影响较大的有华兴会①和光复会②。(Various
revolutionary groups were also established, among which the HuaxingHui
and the Guangfuhu were the two most influential.)

1896年秋，孙中山在伦敦被清政府所派的特务诱捕入中国使馆，(In the autumn
of 1896, Sun Yat-sen was lured into the Chinese embassy in London by
secret agents sent by the Qing government)后来因英国政府干涉获释。(He
was later released for British government
interference.)此事在当时成为著名的国际事件，各种报纸争相报道。(The
incident became a well-known international event at the time, which
various newspapers rushed to
report.)孙中山借此机会撰文宣扬他的政治主张，使国际间对中国革命有了一定的认识。(Sun

    Xu Xilin, Tao Chengzhang, etc., with Cai Yuanpei as its president,
    was the most powerful revolutionary group in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and

在长期的革命斗争中，孙中山的主张逐渐得到其他革命党人的认同，成为革命党公认的领袖。(During
the protracted revolutionary struggle, Sun Yat-sen\'s ideas gradually
gained the approval of other revolutionaries and he became the
recognized leader of the revolutionary party.)

##### 材料研读(Material Reading)

孙逸仙者，近今谈革命者之初祖，实行革命者之北辰，此有耳目者所同认······孙逸仙者，非一氏之私号，乃新中国新发现之名词也。有孙逸仙，而中国始可为··\....

-章士钊《孙逸仙·自序》

为什么孙中山能成为革命党公认的领袖？(Why could Sun Yat-sen become the
recognized leader of the revolutionary party?)

为了集中革命力量，建立统一的革命组织，1905年8月，孙中山联合兴中会、华兴会、光复会等革命团体的成员，在日本东京成立了中国同盟会。(In
order to concentrate revolutionary forces and establish a unified
revolutionary organization, in August 1905, Sun Yat-sen united with
members of revolutionary groups such as the Revive China Society
(Xingzhonghui), the Huaxinghui, and the Guangfuhui to establish the
Chinese United League (Tongmenghui) in Tokyo,
Japan.)在成立大会上，确定了"驱除鞑虏，恢复中华，创立民国，平均地权"的政治纲领，选举孙中山为同盟会总理，建立领导机构。(At
the inaugural meeting, the political guiding principles of \"expelling
the Tartars, restoring China, establishing the Republic of China, and
equalizing land rights\" was confirmed, Sun Yat-sen was elected as the
premier of the League, and a leading body was
established.)大会决定创办《民报》，作为同盟会的机关报。(The congress
decided to create the Min Bao as the organ of the United
League(Tongmenghui).)中国同盟会是第一个全国规模的、统一的资产阶级革命政党。(The
Chinese United League(Tongmenghui) was the first unified bourgeois
revolutionary party on a national
scale.)它的成立，使全国资产阶级革命派有了一个统一的领导和明确的奋斗目标，大大推动了全国革命运动的发展。(Its
establishment has enabled the bourgeois revolutionaries throughout the
country to have a unified leadership and a clear goal of struggle, and

oppression;)民权主义就是"创立民国"，它是三民主义的核心，即推翻君主专制政体，建立资产阶级专政的议会制共和国，国民一律平等，总统和议员由国民选举产生；(democracy

Principles of People, that is, to overthrow the absolute monarchy and
establish a parliamentary republic with a bourgeois dictatorship, in

are elected by the
people;)民生主义就是"平均地权"，即核定全国地价，国家根据核定地价征收地租税，同时逐步向地主收买土地，实现土地国有，解决贫富不均等问题。(people\'s
livelihood referred to the \"equal land rights\", that is, appraising
and fixing the national land price, the state collecting land rent tax
in accordance with the appraised land price, and gradually buying land
from the landlords, in order to realize the nationalization of land and
to solve the problem of inequality between the rich and the poor.)

the heroic spirit of treating death as a homecoming greatly boosted the
fighting spirit of people through the whole country.)
