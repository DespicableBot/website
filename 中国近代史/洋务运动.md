##### 近代化的早期探索与民族危机的加剧(The early exploration of modernization and the intensification of the national crisis)

面对内忧外患，清政府掀起了一场旨在"自强""求富"的洋务运动。(Facing with
internal and external troubles, the Qing government set off a
Self-Strengthening Movement aimed at \"self-improvement\" and \"seeking
prosperity.\")
洋务运动开始了中国近代化的历程，然而清政府在甲午中日战争中的惨败，宣告了洋务运动的破产。(The
Self-Strengthening Movement began the process of China\'s modernization,
but the Qing government\'s disastrous defeat in the Sino-Japanese War
declared the failure of the Self-Strengthening
Movement.)《马关条约》的签订，进一步加剧了中国的民族危机。(The signing
of the Treaty of Shimonoseki has further aggravated China\'s national
crisis.)

为救亡图存，资产阶级维新派宣传变法思想，积极推行变法，但最终遭到失败。(In
order to save the people and survive, the bourgeois reformists
propagated the idea of changing and actively promoted the changing, but
in the end they failed.
)19世纪末，义和团运动兴起，进行反对帝国主义的斗争。。(At the end of the
19th century, the Boxer Rebellion arose and struggled against
imperialism.)八国列强组成联军，发动侵华战争。。(The eight powers formed
an alliance and launched a war of aggression against
China.)清政府被迫签订《辛丑条约》，中国完全陷入半殖民地半封建社会。(The
Qing government was forced to sign the Boxer Protocol, which symbolized
that China was completely plunged into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal
society.)

洋务运动是晚清时期统治集团求强求富的自强运动。(The Self-Strengthening
Movement was implemented by the ruling clique in the late Qing Dynasty
to seek strength and
prosperity.)在洋务运动中，洋务派不仅创办了近代工矿企业、交通运输业、电讯业，而且编练军队，筹设海防，兴办教育。(The
Self-Strengthening Movement, the Westernization faction not only founded
modern industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, and
telecommunications, but also organized and trained the army, prepared
for coastal defense, and established education.
)洋务运动为什么没能实现"自强""求富"的目标呢？ (Why has the
Self-Strengthening Movement failed to achieve the goals of
\"self-strengthening\" and \"seeking prosperity\"?)

#### 洋务运动的兴起(The rise of the Western affairs movement)

第二次鸦片战争后，清朝统治集团内部一些比较开明的官员，主张利用西方先进技术，强兵富国，维护清王朝的统治。(After
the Second Opium War, some relatively enlightened officials in the
ruling clique of the Qing Dynasty advocated using advanced Western
technology to strengthen the army and enrich the country, aiming to
maintain the rule of the Qing Dynasty. )这些官员被称为"洋务派"。(These
officials were known as the \" Westernization faction \".
)洋务派在中央以恭亲王奕诉为代表，在地方以曾国藩、李鸿章、左宗棠、张之洞等人为代表。(The
Westernization faction were represented by Yisu in the central
government and by Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, Zuo Zongtang, Zhang
Zhidong, etc. at the local
level.)从19世纪60年代到90年代中期，他们掀起了一场旨在"自强""求富"的洋务运动。(From
the 1860s to the mid-1890s, they set off a Self-Strengthening Movement
aimed at \"self-strengthening\" and \"seeking prosperity\".)

图 1李鸿章

李鸿章，安徽合肥人。曾仿照曾国藩的湘军组建淮军，(Li Hongzhang, born in
Hefei, Anhui Province, once formed the Huai Army, imitating Zeng
Guofan\'s Xiang Army.)靠镇压太平天国和捻军起家。(He started his career
by suppressing the Taiping Rebellion and the Nian
Army.)历任江苏巡抚、直隶总督兼北洋大臣等职务。(He successively served as
the Inspector of Jiangsu, the Direct Viceroy and the Minister of
Beiyang.)19世纪60年代以后热心洋务，提出"外须和戎，内须变法"的主张。(After
the 1860s, he was enthusiastic about foreign affairs, and put forward
the proposition of \"making peace with Rong externally, and implementing
reform
internally\".)对外主持签订了《马关条约》《辛丑条约》等一系列丧权辱国的不平等条约；对内兴办了江南制造总局、轮船招商局等一系列军事和民用企业，创建了北洋海军。(He
presided over the signing of a series of unequal treaties that
humiliated the country, such as *the Treaty of Shimonoseki* and *the
Boxer Protocol*， established a series of military and civilian
enterprises, such as the Jiangnan General Manufacturing Bureau and the
Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau, and created the Beiyang Navy.)

###### 创办近代军事和民用企业(Establishment of modern military and civilian enterprises)

从19世纪60年代起，洋务派以"自强"为口号，发展近代军事工业，先后创办了安庆内军械所、江南制造总局、福州船政局等一批近代军事工业。(Since
the 1860s, under the slogan of \"self-strengthening\", the
Westernization faction has developed modern military industries, and
successively founded Anqing inner Ordnance Institute, the Jiangnan
General Manufacturing Bureau, and the Fuzhou Shipping
Bureau.)为了洋务的需要，洋务派还兴办新式学校，培养翻译和军事人才；(In
order to meet the needs of foreign affairs, the Westernization faction
also set up new schools to train translators and military
talents)设立翻译馆，翻译外国科技书籍；派遣留学生出国深造等。(They set up
translation halls to translate foreign scientific and technological
books; and sent students overseas to study abroad.)

从19世纪70年代起，洋务派在继续发展军事工业的同时，又提出"求富"的主张，开办一些近代民用企业，以辅助军事工业。(From
the 1870s onwards, while continuing to develop the military industry,
the Westernization faction also put forward the idea of \"seeking
prosperity\" and opened some modern civilian enterprises to supplement
the military industry.
)其中比较重要的有轮船招商局、开平煤矿、汉阳铁厂、湖北织布局等。(Among
them, the Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau, Kaiping Coal Mines, Hanyang
Iron Works, Hubei Fabric Bureau, etc. are the more important ones.)

图 3轮船招商局

洋务派办的军事工业，全是官办性质，(The military industries set up by the
Westernization faction were all official
nature.)不但不能自主经营，而且在管理方式上还存在官僚衙门的恶习。( It not
only failed to operate on its own, but also had the vice of bureaucratic
Yamen in the term of management methods.)
以福州船政局为例，局内人员的"薪水工食"竟占了全部经费的80％。(Taking the
Fuzhou Shipping Bureau as an example, spending on the \"salary and
food\" of the bureau\'s personnel accounted for 80% of the total
expenditure.)它们的生产成本高，效率低下，管理水平远远低于国外的同类企业。(With
high production costs, they were inefficient, whose management levels
were far lower than those similar enterprises
abroad.)在官督商办的民用企业中，这类问题也同样存在。(In the civilian
enterprises, which ran in commercial mode under supervision of
government , such problems also existed.)

轮船招商局长期使用官款，发展迅速。(Having used official funds for a long
time, the Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau developed
rapidly.)该局成立时只有3艘轮船，1877年收购美国旗昌轮船公司以后，拥有轮船30多艘，形成一支实力较强的商船队。(The
bureau was founded with only 3 ships, but after the acquisition of the
American Qichang Steamship Company in 1877, it owned more than 30 ships,
forming a strong merchant fleet.
)1873年至1893年，它获利白银600多万两，但大都归入李鸿章等人的私囊。(From
1873 to 1893, it made more than 6 million taels of silver, but most of
them went into the private pockets of Li Hongzhang and other related
people.)

###### 建立新式海陆军(Building of the New Navies and Armies)

从19世纪60年代起，洋务派开始组建新式洋枪队，淘汰传统兵器，采用西式兵操练兵，使清朝军队的武器和战术逐渐发生变化。(From
the 1860s onwards, the Westernization faction began to form a new type
of foreign gun teams, eliminating traditional weapons and using Western
method to train troops, which gradually changed the weapons and tactics
of the Qing army.)

从19世纪70年代起，洋务派开始大规模进行近代海防建设，筹建新式海军。(From
the 1870s onwards, the Westernization faction began to carry out
large-scale building of the modern coastal defense and prepare for the
building of the new
navies.)到80年代，初步建成了南洋、北洋和福建三支海军，其中以北洋舰队规模最大。(By
the 1980s, three navies had been initially built, namely the Nanyang,
Beiyang and Fujian navies, among which the Beiyang Fleet was the
largest.)1885年，清政府成立海军衙门统一协调指挥。(In 1885, the Qing
government established a Yamen of Navy for unified coordination and
command.)

![](media/image4.jpeg){width="4.083333333333333in"
height="2.3472222222222223in"}洋务运动是中国历史上第一次近代化运动。(The
Self-Strengthening Movement was the first modernization movement in
Chinese
history.)经过30多年的建设，中国近代化的军事工业、民用企业、交通运输业等逐渐发展起来，在客观上促进了中国民族资本主义的产生，对外国资本的入侵起到了一定的抵制作用。(After
more than 30 years of building, China\'s modernized military industry,
civilian enterprises, transportation industry, etc. have gradually
developed, objectively promoting the emergence of Chinese national
capitalism and playing a certain role in resisting the invasion of
foreign capital.)
但由于洋务运动的根本目的是维护和巩固清政府的统治，再加上其内部的腐败和外国势力的挤压，它没有使中国走上富强的道路。(However,
because the fundamental purpose of the Self-Strengthening Movement was
to maintain and consolidate the rule of the Qing government, and it
encountered its internal corruption as well as the squeeze of foreign
forces, it did not put China on the road to prosperity and strength.)

甲午中日战争是日本蓄意挑起的一场侵华战争。(The Sino-Japanese War was a
war of aggression against China deliberately waged by
Japan.)它以清政府的失败而告终，并引发了后来的"瓜分"中国狂潮。(It ended
with the defeat of the Qing government and sparked the later frenzy of
\"partitioning\" China.)

左宝贵，山东费县人，回族。(Zuo Baogui was a native of Fei County,
Shandong. )甲午中日战争爆发后，奉命率部进援朝鲜。(After the outbreak of
the Sino-Japanese War, he was ordered to lead his troops to aid Korea.
)平壤战役打响后，负责防守城北玄武门一线，(After the Battle of Pyongyang
began, he was responsible for defending the first line of Xuanwu Gate
which was the northern part of the city)带病登城指挥。(Although he was
ill, he still climbed up the gate tower to take command of the
army.)当部将劝他摘下红缨帽，脱掉黄马褂，以免引起敌人注意时，他却坚定地说：我之所以穿朝服，就是想让士卒们知道我还在，这样他们就会同敌人血战到底。(When
his subordinate advised him to take off his red hat his yellow coat so
as not to attract the attention of the enemy, he said firmly: The reason
why I wear the imperial robe is to let the soldiers know that I am still
here, so they will fight the enemy to the end.)

### 甲午中日战争(the Sino-Japanese War)

日本对朝鲜觊觎已久，征服朝鲜是日本企图实现侵略中国、称霸世界的重要步骤。(Japan
had coveted Korea for a long time, and conquering Korea was an important
step in Japan\'s attempt to invade China and dominate the whole world.)
1894年，朝鲜发生东学党起义。(In 1894, Dongxue Party rebelled in
Korea.)应朝鲜国王请求，清政府派兵帮助镇压。(Responding to the request of
the King of Joseon, the Qing government sent troops to help suppress
it.)日本也乘机出兵,( Japan also took the opportunity to send troops to
Korea)朝鲜东学党起义平息后，日本继续增兵朝鲜，蓄意挑起战争。(After the
uprising was quelled, and Japan continued to increase its troops in
Korea and deliberately started a war.
)7月，日军进攻驻守朝鲜的中国军队，并在牙山口外丰岛海面袭击清军运兵船。(In
July, the Japanese attacked the Chinese troops stationed in Korea and
attacked Qing troop carriers.)清政府被迫对日宣战。(The Qing government
was compelled to declare war on Japan.)
1894年是农历甲午年这场战争被称为"甲午中日战争"。(This war was known as
the \"Sino-Japanese War\".)

9月，日军分多路围攻平壤。(In September, the Japanese besieged Pyongyang
in multiple ways. )中国守军奋起反击，清军将领左宝贵中炮牺牲。(The
Chinese defenders fought back, and Zuo Baogui, a Qing general, was
killed.)统帅叶志超弃城逃跑，(The commander, Ye Zhichao, abandoned the
city and fled)平壤陷落 (And then, Pyongyang fell.)

北洋舰队与日本联合舰队在黄海海面也展开激战。(The Beiyang Fleet and the
Japanese Combined Fleet also fought fiercely on the Yellow
Sea.)北洋舰队将士在战斗中奋勇杀敌，重创日舰。(The soldiers of the
Beiyang Fleet killed the enemy bravely in the battle and severely
damaged the Japanese warships.
)致远舰管带邓世昌在舰身严重受损、弹药将尽之际，下令开足马力，冲向日舰吉野号，准备与敌人同归于尽，(When
the ship\'s hull was seriously damaged and the ammunition was about to
run out, Deng Shichang, the captain of the cruiser Chih Yuen, ordered to
rush to the Japanese warship Yoshino with full horsepower, preparing to
die with the
enemy)不幸被敌人炮弹击中，200余名将士壮烈殉国。(Unfortunately, their
cruiser was hit by enemy shells, and more than 200 soldiers
died.)此次海战，北洋舰队损失较大，但主力尚存。(In this naval battle, the
Beiyang Fleet suffered greater losses, but its main force still
existed.)可惜战后李鸿章命令舰队躲进威海卫军港，不许出海迎敌，(However,
after the war, Li Hongzhang ordered the fleet to hide in the Weihai Port
and not to go out to meet the enemy,)日军趁机夺取了制海权。( The
Japanese took the opportunity to seize the command of the sea.)

邓世昌，广东番禺人。福州船政学堂首届毕业生，(Deng Shichang, born in
Panyu, Guangdong, graduated from Fuzhou Navy
School)后调赴北洋舰队，任致远舰管带。(He was later transferred to the
Beiyang Fleet and served as the captain of the cruiser Chih
Yuen.)平时钻研海军战术，严格训练。(He studied naval tactics hard and
trained strictly. )1894年，在黄海海战中与同舰官兵壮烈殉国。(In 1894, he
was died in the Battle on the Yellow Sea with the officers of the same
ship.)

之后，日军分两路入侵中国。(After that, the Japanese army invaded China
in two ways. )一路渡鸭绿江，占领九连城等地，直逼辽阳。(Has crossed the
Yalu River, one troop occupied Jiulian City and some other places,
directly approaching Liaoyang.
)另一路从辽东半岛登陆，直取大连、旅顺。(Another troop landed on the
Liaodong Peninsula, and occupied Dalian and Lushun
directly.)大连守将不战而逃，(The defenders in Dalian fled without a
fight,)旅顺守将大多庸懦畏敌，只有徐邦道孤军迎敌，(Most of the defenders
in Lushun were cowardly and fearful of the enemy, and only Xu Bangdao
together with his soldiers fought against the enemy
alone)血战四天，终因寡不敌众而战败。(They fought fiercely for four days,
and finally lost because they was heavily outnumbered by the enemy.)
